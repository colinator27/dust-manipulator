## Shader compilation instructions

Add a `shadercross` binary to your system/shell path (temporarily, if desired). This can be obtained from https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_shadercross, built manually or by using automated builds.

Then, run `compile.bat` or `compile.sh` from this directory, which will create the directories and compile all of the necessary shaders for all output types.
