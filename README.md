# dust-manipulator

An assortment of programs intended for use in UNDERTALE speedruns. Contains a lot of experimental and unfinished code.

As this is currently unfinished, the code quality and structure is a bit all over the place. PRs to improve this are very welcome, so long as they don't conflict with anything being worked on.

## Install and usage instructions

TBD

## Build instructions

For the main program itself, the regular Rust build pipeline should work fine. There is a large dependency on SDL3 and related libraries.

To compile the shaders used in multiple programs, see the [shaders/README.md file](shaders/README.md).

The OBS plugin used for taking screenshots is a separate component, currently located [here](https://github.com/colinator27/dust-manipulator-plugin).
